# Travis McClellen's Resume

This is my resume. It features a responsive design, some simple unobtrusive animations, inline svg images, and dynamically built content that allows for different skills and achievements to be highlighted depending upon the focus of the resume. 

## Building

The resume works just fine as three separate source files, but in order to deliver a single html page I've included a simple ruby script to combine them. combine.rb takes the output file name as an argument and stores the output in the parent directory under that name.
