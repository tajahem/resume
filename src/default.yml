        <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to check out my resume.</p>
        <p>As this is the generic version intended for places where employers can find me, this cover letter will first focus on ways I feel I would be beneficial to most any organization and then go into a few of the things I'm looking for in a perspective job opening.</p>
        <p>I am exceptional at breaking things down into manageable chunks and seeing the connections between different disciplines. This makes picking up new skills and knowledge a fairly quick and painless process so that I am able to grow my abilities to meet the needs of a business. I am not intimidated by the prospect of learning about something I've never dealt with before and have even taken the time to dig into how a lot of technology works at some of the lowest levels.</p>
        <p>I am constantly improving, and, while my focus has primarily been on technology, I have also delved into graphics, animation, and music as well. I can pivot between most tasks fairly quickly, but have the ability to keep focus on work related activities during working hours.</p>
        <p>I have a fairly good sense of humor, and, given my upbringing and work history, tend to be able to maintain a civil and polite disposition even in trying circumstances.</p>
        <p>I am currently looking for a job in software development. As most of my experience with development comes in the form of game prototypes, which can be thought of as overly complicated User Interfaces, something with a bent towards UI/UX would likely be the easiest role to slip into. A remote position would be preferable for my current circumstances, but I would be willing to relocate for the right position.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
